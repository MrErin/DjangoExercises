# Django Exercises

This repo holds several projects for learning Django, all tutorial-based (i.e., they have very little in the way of content.)

## Note

For all of the projects, it's fine to use the same virtual environment (in the case of the local computer, it's myvenv in this directory, not uploaded to GitHub).

## Contents
